This repo contains the dotfiles relative to my personal configuration

# nvim
I created a symlink for the nvim config files like this:

```bash
ln -s ~/Documents/Dev/dotfiles/.config/nvim  ~/.config
```

# tmux
All my tmux config was taken from [devaslife](https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public/blob/master/.tmux.conf). He also has a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSOfr2MtRU8) showcasing how he uses it.

## Useful commands

 - The prefix key was remapped to CTRL-T
 - <prefix> c: creates a new window
 - <prefix> n: moves to the **next** window
 - <prefix> p: moves to the **previous** window
 - <prefix> &: exits tmux environment
 - <prefix> ?: shows all tmux key bindings

A symlink was created referencing this repo like below:
